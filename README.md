# Zabbuino
An Zabbix agent firmware for Arduino

Actual release is v1.4 (**AVR only**).

Testing release is v1.5 (**AVR & ESP8266 & ESP32** [here](https://github.com/zbx-sadman/zabbuino/tree/esp-integration-test).

Compilation tested on Arduino IDE 1.6.11 (from https://www.arduino.cc/) and above.

**Note: Zabbuino is not any kind of Arduino library. It is a "ready-to-use" project. Rename "zabbuino-master" dir to "zabbuino" just after cloning/downloading/unzipping/etc. to avoid compilation error.**

All new features can be found on [experimental](https://github.com/zbx-sadman/Zabbuino/tree/experimental) branch. Old releases placed in [old_releases](https://github.com/zbx-sadman/Zabbuino/tree/old_releases) branch.


See [change log](https://github.com/zbx-sadman/Zabbuino/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) before update.

**You can help to the project** by providing new ideas and/or hardware to testing and integrating. Or yo–≥ can just donate for further development. Contact to me via [email](mailto://zbx.sadman@gmail.com) or use
